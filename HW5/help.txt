This program uses fifth types of primary arguments:
1. create - create entry of user
2. read - read entry of user by email or read all user storage
3. update - update user data (email, name, password, phone)
4. delete - delete user entry or all database
5. exit

email "all" - forbidden due to using in commands "update" and "delete" as indicator of action with whole storage.

In case of wrong command entry program prints "Wrong action. Please enter create or read, or update, or delete actions"
